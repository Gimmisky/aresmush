# Psyche
This command lets you record a character's Psyche so it will be displayed in their wiki page. The character's Psyche is the very essence of who they are, their soul and their wants, their motivations and desires. This can change over the course of play, and might be altered by the Regenesis Ritual. Your Psyche is visible to all players.

`psyche` - Shows your own Psyche.
`psyche/set <gift>` - Sets your Psyche.
`psyche <name>` - View another character's Psyche.
