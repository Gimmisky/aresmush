# Gift
This command lets you record a character's mutant Gift so it will be displayed in their wiki page. The character's Gift is central to them, as mutants identify their powers as part of who they are. These may evolve and new ones might develop during play. Your powers are visible to all players.

`gift` - Shows your own Gift.
`gift/set <gift>` - Sets your Gift.
`gift <name>` - View another character's Gift.
