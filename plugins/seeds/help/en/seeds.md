# Seeds

Seeds are plot bits sent to you by staff.

`seeds` - Views a list of your seeds, most recent first. The first line of the seed text will be shown. For subsequent pages, use `seeds2` etc.
`seeds/view <seed number>` - View the full text of a specific seed.

Your most recent few Seeds are also viewable on the site, under the Seeds tab in your character profile.
